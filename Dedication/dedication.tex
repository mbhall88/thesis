\begin{dedication} 

I dedicate this work to my beloved wife, and best friend, Caitlin. Despite these years on opposite sides of the world, you always ensured we were the preeminent people in each other's lives. Without your unwavering support, I could not have produced these pages. Thank you.

This work is also dedicated to my parents - all three sets of you. To my parents and their partners, without your guidance and love, I would not be the man I am today. You taught me that hard work is the best way to succeed. And to my parents-in-law, your steadfast encouragement is an absolute blessing.

I love you all.
