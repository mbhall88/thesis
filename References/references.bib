abstract = {{A human genome is sequenced and assembled de novo using a pocket-sized nanopore device. We report the sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for the human GM12878 Utah/Ceph cell line using the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) nanopore sequencer. 91.2 Gb of sequence data, representing ∼30× theoretical coverage, were produced. Reference-based alignment enabled detection of large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. De novo assembly of nanopore reads alone yielded a contiguous assembly (NG50 ∼3 Mb). We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 > 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%. Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus in its entirety, measurement of telomere repeat length, and closure of gaps in the reference human genome assembly GRCh38.}},

abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental
data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a
significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications
in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by
error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application
of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a
set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the
image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on
the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented
for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide
the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

abstract = {{Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used to aid the understanding of pathogen transmission. A first step in analyzing WGS data is usually to define "transmission clusters," sets of cases that are potentially linked by direct transmission. This is often done by including two cases in the same cluster if they are separated by fewer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than a specified threshold. However, there is little agreement as to what an appropriate threshold should be. We propose a probabilistic alternative, suggesting that the key inferential target for transmission clusters is the number of transmissions separating cases. We characterize this by combining the number of SNP differences and the length of time over which those differences have accumulated, using information about case timing, molecular clock, and transmission processes. Our framework has the advantage of allowing for variable mutation rates across the genome and can incorporate other epidemiological data. We use two tuberculosis studies to illustrate the impact of our approach: with British Columbia data by using spatial divisions; with Republic of Moldova data by incorporating antibiotic resistance. Simulation results indicate that our transmission-based method is better in identifying direct transmissions than a SNP threshold, with dissimilarity between clusterings of on average 0.27 bits compared with 0.37 bits for the SNP-threshold method and 0.84 bits for randomly permuted data. These results show that it is likely to outperform the SNP-threshold method where clock rates are variable and sample collection times are spread out. We implement the method in the R package transcluster.}},
