We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 > 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%.

error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application
of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a
set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the
image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on
the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented
for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide
the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

abstract = {{Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used to aid the understanding of pathogen transmission. A first step in analyzing WGS data is usually to define "transmission clusters," sets of cases that are potentially linked by direct transmission. This is often done by including two cases in the same cluster if they are separated by fewer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than a specified threshold. However, there is little agreement as to what an appropriate threshold should be. We propose a probabilistic alternative, suggesting that the key inferential target for transmission clusters is the number of transmissions separating cases. We characterize this by combining the number of SNP differences and the length of time over which those differences have accumulated, using information about case timing, molecular clock, and transmission processes. Our framework has the advantage of allowing for variable mutation rates across the genome and can incorporate other epidemiological data. We use two tuberculosis studies to illustrate the impact of our approach: with British Columbia data by using spatial divisions; with Republic of Moldova data by incorporating antibiotic resistance. Simulation results indicate that our transmission-based method is better in identifying direct transmissions than a SNP threshold, with dissimilarity between clusterings of on average 0.27 bits compared with 0.37 bits for the SNP-threshold method and 0.84 bits for randomly permuted data. These results show that it is likely to outperform the SNP-threshold method where clock rates are variable and sample collection times are spread out. We implement the method in the R package transcluster.}},

Whole-genome sequencing can detect microevolution within Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. We aimed to estimate the genetic diversity of related M tuberculosis strains in the UK Midlands and to investigate how this measurement might be used to investigate community outbreaks. Methods In a retrospective observational study, we used Illumina technology to sequence M tuberculosis genomes from an archive of frozen cultures. We characterised isolates into four groups: cross-sectional, longitudinal, household, and community. We measured pairwise nucleotide differences within hosts and between hosts in household outbreaks and estimated the rate of change in DNA sequences. We used the findings to interpret network diagrams constructed from 11 community clusters derived from mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit–variable-number tandem-repeat data. Findings We sequenced 390 separate isolates from 254 patients, including representatives from all five major lineages of M tuberculosis. The estimated rate of change in DNA sequences was 0·5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per genome per year (95\% CI 0·3–0·7) in longitudinal isolates from 30 individuals and 25 families. Divergence is rarely higher than five SNPs in 3 years. 109 (96\%) of 114 paired isolates from individuals and households differed by five or fewer SNPs. More than five SNPs separated isolates from none of 69 epidemiologically linked patients, two (15\%) of 13 possibly linked patients, and 13 (17\%) of 75 epidemiologically unlinked patients (three-way comparison exact p<0·0001). Genetic trees and clinical and epidemiological data suggest that super-spreaders were present in two community clusters. Interpretation Whole-genome sequencing can delineate outbreaks of tuberculosis and allows inference about direction of transmission between cases. The technique could identify super-spreaders and predict the existence of undiagnosed cases, potentially leading to early treatment of infectious patients and their contacts.

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.

Genetic divergence from the reference genome, repetitive sequences, and sequencing bias, reduce the performance of variant calling using short-read alignment, but the loss in recall and specificity has not been adequately characterized. For the clonal pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), researchers frequently exclude 10.7\% of the genome believed to be repetitive and prone to erroneous variant calls. To benchmark short-read variant calling, we used 36 diverse clinical Mtb isolates dually sequenced with Illumina short-reads and PacBio long-reads. We systematically study the short-read variant calling accuracy and the influence of sequence uniqueness, reference bias, and GC content. Reference based Illumina variant calling had a recall ≥89.0\% and precision ≥98.5\% across parameters evaluated. The best balance between precision and recall was achieved by tuning the mapping quality (MQ) threshold, i.e. confidence of the read mapping (recall 85.8\%, precision 99.1\% at MQ ≥ 40). Masking repetitive sequence content is an alternative conservative approach to variant calling that maintains high precision (recall 70.2\%, precision 99.6\% at MQ≥40). Of the genomic positions typically excluded for Mtb, 68\% are accurately called using Illumina WGS including 52 of the 168 PE/PPE genes (34.5\%). We present a refined list of low confidence regions and examine the largest sources of variant calling error. Our improved approach to variant calling has broad implications for the use of WGS in the study of Mtb biology, inference of transmission in public health surveillance systems, and more generally for WGS applications in other organisms.}},

The pattern of deletions detected was identical within mycobacterial clones but differed between different clones, suggesting that this is a suitable genotyping system for epidemiologic studies. An analysis of genomic deletions among an extant population of pathogenic bacteria provided a novel perspective on genomic organization and evolution. Deletions are likely to contain ancestral genes whose functions are no longer essential for the organism's survival, whereas genes that are never deleted constitute the minimal mycobacterial genome. As the amount of genomic deletion increased, the likelihood that the bacteria will cause pulmonary cavitation decreased, suggesting that the accumulation of mutations tends to diminish their pathogenicity.

We confirm that East Asian lineage comprises two major clades, designated proto-Beijing, which harbors unusual 43-signal spoligoprofile, and Beijing, with well-known spoligoprofile (deleted signals from 1 to 34). We show that different genotyping methods give high consistency results in description of ancient Beijing strains while the classification of modern Beijing strains is significantly divergent due to star-shaped phylogeny. Using WGS data we intersect different studies and for the first time provide balanced classification with well-defined major groups and their genetic markers.

abstract = {{Sebastien Gagneux and colleagues analyze a global collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to classify sublineages by phylogeography. They find globally distributed ‘generalist’ and geographically restricted ‘specialist’ sublineages of lineage 4, indicating that different evolutionary strategies were adopted to succeed in various ecological niches. Generalist and specialist species differ in the breadth of their ecological niches. Little is known about the niche width of obligate human pathogens. Here we analyzed a global collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage 4 clinical isolates, the most geographically widespread cause of human tuberculosis. We show that lineage 4 comprises globally distributed and geographically restricted sublineages, suggesting a distinction between generalists and specialists. Population genomic analyses showed that, whereas the majority of human T cell epitopes were conserved in all sublineages, the proportion of variable epitopes was higher in generalists. Our data further support a European origin for the most common generalist sublineage. Hence, the global success of lineage 4 reflects distinct strategies adopted by different sublineages and the influence of human migration.}},

abstract = {{Motivation: We present a new feature of the MAFFT multiple alignment program for suppressing over-alignment (aligning unrelated segments). Conventional MAFFT is highly sensitive in aligning conserved regions in remote homologs, but the risk of over-alignment is recently becoming greater, as low-quality or noisy sequences are increasing in protein sequence databases, due, for example, to sequencing errors and difficulty in gene prediction. Results: The proposed method utilizes a variable scoring matrix for different pairs of sequences (or groups) in a single multiple sequence alignment, based on the global similarity of each pair. This method significantly increases the correctly gapped sites in real examples and in simulations under various conditions. Regarding sensitivity, the effect of the proposed method is slightly negative in real protein-based benchmarks, and mostly neutral in simulation-based benchmarks. This approach is based on natural biological reasoning and should be compatible with many methods based on dynamic programming for multiple sequence alignment. Availability and implementation: The new feature is available in MAFFT versions 7.263 and higher. http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/ Contact:katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

We introduce a scalable variant, G-large-INS-1, which has equivalent accuracy to G-INS-1 and is applicable to 50 000 or more sequences.}},

It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.
