My supervisor Zamin Iqbal who always knows the right questions to ask. Simon Grandjean Lapierre helped conceive of this study, along with Zam, and whose clinical perspective helped keep me grounded in the real world. I would also like to acknowledge the many insightful conversations with our other collaborators: Marie Sylvianne Rabodoarivelo, Anastasia Koch, Niaina Rakotosamimanana, Anzaan Dippenaar, and Helen Cox. Furthermore, Tim Peto, whose input helped shape some of the clustering evaluation.
